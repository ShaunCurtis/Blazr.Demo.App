# Blazr Demonstration Template

This template combines the out-of-the-box Blazor Server and Web Assembly templates into a single solution.  The projects are re-organised to:

1. Apply Sound Design principles. 
2. Re-organise the code base so the Blazor Server and WASM SPA's are two implementation of the same code base.
